Always follow the constraints defined in:
[/Users/gardsale/Projects/Makeup - YELLOW - 2/.agent/rules.md](file:///Users/gardsale/Projects/Makeup%20-%20YELLOW%20-%202/.agent/rules.md)

Key Highlights:
- **DOM/Structure LOCK**: No HTML changes without approval.
- **Desktop Protection**: Visual parity (100%) for desktop is mandatory.
- **Mobile-First**: Base classes = Mobile, `md:` = Desktop restore.
- **Priority**: Emotional safety and calm rhythm.
- **No Verification**: Final verification steps/tools are no longer required at the end of tasks.
